# E-Commerce-Back-End

## Description

In this week, we initialized and used a database for the back end of a theroetical e-commerce website using Sequelize. We were required to create different models as well as complete the routes used to update the database. this required creating a cateogry model for product categories, a product model which referenced the category model to see which category it was in, a tag model for products, and then a productTag model to link the product and tag models because they can have a many-to-many relationship. In addition to creating the models, we were required to finish the CRUD routes. The video linked below demonstrates the routes being used for each model. Please note that there are no front-end files for the application, it is all based on a server.

## Installation

Uses the mysql2, express, dotenv, and sequelize packages

## Usage

This application can be used to manage a website that is used for shopping on the internet. How it is used depends on the user's intent. It can be used to display the products individually, searched by name, or by category. Although it is very superficial, it could be updated to support a company's online retail.
